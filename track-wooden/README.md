# dotscad.trains/track-wooden

This directory contains a variety of different libraries for rendering train track compatible with the wooden trains
made popular by Thomas and Brio (among other brands).

Because there are so many permutations of track, most of the STL files have been placed into their own subdirectories.

Additionally, in order to get the most value out of your printed materials, I would recommend that you look primarily
at the all-female-connector track variations and use the dog-bone connector from this same module when you need a
male connection for your layout.
