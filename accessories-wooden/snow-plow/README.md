Snow Plow Accessory designed for Brio/Thomas style wooden trains

This is designed to look more like the plow on the "Adventures of Thomas" train than a
real snow plow.  The tilted-up bottom edge of the blade is required to prevent it from
getting stuck when the toy train goes down a slope.

Though I've found that this will stay connected to many trains without assistance, I
have left enough room inside of the magnet cavity to glue in a small ceramic magnet
like the ones available here:
