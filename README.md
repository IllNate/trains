# dotscad.trainlib

This module is an attempt to create a comprehensive OpenSCAD library for
everything relating to modular toy trains most often seen under the Brio and
Thomas brand names.

## tracklib.scad library

The core of this will be a `tracklib.scad` file (not currently separated from
the individual Things used to test its modules) which will contain OpenSCAD
modules for rendering various parts of train track for the different types
of track families (wooden, trackmaster, take-n-play)

## Things

The actual Things in this repository are grouped together by category and
family:


* `parts.*`
    * Parts used to build compatible train toys
* `accessories.*`
    * Things used to accessorize the trains and enhance/improve play (e.g. a
      snow plow for wooden trains, or a clip to hold track together).
* `track-*`
    * Actual pieces of track, to supplement your own supply
* `track-adapters`
    * A special category for adapters used to bridge different families of
      track, or even different types of toy (e.g. Lego).
